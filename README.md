Python Discord bot for FFXIV oriented tasks.

Feel free to use this code however you want, but I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING. 

I won't help you if: 
 - you don't understand python
 - you don't understand discord bots
 - your computer becomes sentient
 - aliens steal your stuff
 - you get hacked/fished/otherwise
 - and such...

 You CAN however contact me if:
  - you want to discuss something (idealy related to the project)
  - you found a bug
  - you're interested in adding a feature

  But i'm not taking feature requests. If i find your sugesstion interesting i MIGHT code it. But making a pull request will have the highest chance of actually adding the feature.
